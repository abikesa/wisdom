    "The \"quality\" of AI is linked to the number of parameters needed to accurately predict the needs of individual users. With 10 billion humans, 10,000 genetic loci, each with 2-100 variants, and with functional interactions amongst them and environement, you can do the math to show that there's no upper limit to the quality of AI.\n",

    "Quick deployment and transportation do not seem to be limiting factors in this landscape of affairs. Its the sheer amount of \"compute\" and the energy it will demand. We are less inclined to bothere ourselves with the quality of the data on which it is trained, since simulation is a viable alternative, with increased quality of simulations over time"
