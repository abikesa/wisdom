O, there be players that I have seen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it profanely, that, ... they `imitated` humanity so abominably - Hamlet* \n",

It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is `not imitative`! Don’t stop. I want music to-night - Lord Henry Wotton*\n",
